# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking squares with "X" or "O," aiming to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game can end in a win or a tie if all squares are filled. Simple yet strategic, it teaches critical thinking and is popular among players of all ages.
